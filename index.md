Hello!  

##### Who I am:  
I am a 3rd year phd student at the university of maryland.  

##### What I do:
- I use category theory to create models for knowledge representation, called "Ontologies"
- I (try to) create user friendly interfaces for creating ontologies
- I host an Applied Category Theory group at UMD [mdcats](https://mdcats.github.io)

##### My hopes and dreams:  
The "Applied Category Theory" movement is relatively new and it has JUST branched out of mathematics to other sciences and engineering. My hope is that categorical reasoning, that is, a mix of ontological and functional paradigms, will extend beyond STEM. Can we create a conceptual representation paradigm in category theory, with tools accessible enough for *all humans* to reason and communicate with? I think this can be done with a good notion of ontology.


##### Besides math:
- I read a lot of existentialism. My favorite Authors include Sartre and Camus, and poets like George Williams.  
- I'm a big fan of rock, jazz, and rap. My all time favorites include Hiromi Uehara, and Kendrick Lamar
- I love to hike

##### A little History:
- I grew up on Long Island, in high school I was interested in Robotics and Physics
- I attended the University of Rochester, majoring in Physics and Math
