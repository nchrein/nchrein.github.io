hi, I'm Noah Chrein. 

### I am 
a 5th year phd student at the University of Maryland.

### I Create 
categorical meta-theories of ontology and knowledge representation

My current favorite is the virtual double simplicial set. 
- knowledge representation in arbitrary structures
- cross structural morphisms and their calculus

### I dream
- An interface for humans to create structural representation
- A connection to machine learning
