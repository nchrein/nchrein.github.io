I have an interest in developing a generic model for knowledge representation. These models, called ontologies, are highly formal and developed in the language of category theory. Although category theory is said to be "highly abstract" and "inaccessible" to non-mathematicians, all humans seem to have an intuitive understanding of informally "breaking down" concepts into subconcepts. Golog is a GUI for breaking down ideas in a hierarchical simplicial set. It is something people can use.

[golog](https://github.com/nopounch/golog) is a user-friendly<sup>(*!)</sup> graphical interface for creating hierarchical ontologies, specifically hierarchical graphs, with the capability of attaching arbitrary data to nodes. 

example node data: golog, .tex, .pdf, .py, .txt, .... 

#### \* WARNING:
This program is experimental, and has the capability to execute  files on your computer.

(only if you tell it to, and it will ask you first).
